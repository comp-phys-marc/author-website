                        </b>
                        <p>
                            Blockchain technology is facing critical issues of scalability, efficiency and sustainability. These problems are necessary to solve if 
                            blockchain is to become a technology that can be used responsibly. Useful quantum computers could potentially be developed by the time 
                            that blockchain will be widely implemented for mission-critical work at financial and other institutions. Quantum computing will not 
                            only cause challenges for blockchain, but can also be harnessed to better implement parts of blockchain technologies including 
                            cryptocurrencies. We review the work that has been done in the area of quantum blockchain and hybrid quantum–classical blockchain technology 
                            and discuss open questions that remain.

                            Towards Readout-Aware Layout Synthesis for Spin Qubit Systems with Double Quantum Dot Readouts
                        </b>
                        <p>
                            A quantum compiler is required to run a quantum circuit on a quantum computer, similar to how classical compilers are 
                            required to run programs on classical computers. Spin qubits are a promising candidate for scalable quantum computers. 
                            General-purpose quantum compilers can be used for spin qubit devices, however they do not consider additional constraints
                            imposed due to Double-Quantum-Dot (DQD) readout. For DQD readout, when a qubit in an algorithm is measured, the compiler
                            must remap and re-route it to be adjacent to a special-purpose readout qubit, which is preserved in a known state. 
                            Moreover, this should be done in a way that minimizes overhead and maximizes the fidelity, in particular, due to noise
                            in the readout process. This work formulates readout constraints to extend SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theory)-based 
                            layout synthesis techniques proposed in [1] to spin qubit architectures. We define a metric, readout depth, to quantify
                            the overheads incurred. Preliminary results, obtained from benchmarking GHZ and variational quantum eigensolver 
                            circuits on architectures with grid topologies, highlight the algorithmic tradeoffs that arise. We expect ongoing 
                            work on scaling up the methods to a larger set of algorithms will help inform the decisions of spin qubit hardware 
                            designers.

                            Quantum Honest Byzantine Agreement as a Distributed Quantum Algorithm
                        </b>
                        <p>
                            We suggest that the Quantum Honest Byzantine Agreement (QHBA) protocol [1] essentially reduces consensus to 
                            coincidence. The volume of coincidence is the parameter that drives a receiver to echo its input. A lack of 
                            coincidence results in no output from a receiver. This is a similar mechanism therefore to the learning mechanism 
                            in cognitive modular neural architectures like Haikonen's architecture [2]. We introduce a simple feedback mechanism 
                            and quantum neuron to realize a hybrid quantum / classical machine learning network of simple nodes.

                            Designing a Hybrid Digital/Analog Quantum Physics Emulator as Open Hardware
                        </b>
                        <p>
                            One of the most exciting quantum emulation [1] breakthroughs was the first analog signal-based emulation of a 
                            universal quantum computer [2]. This yielded a very interesting paper, but no practical use - even for theorists. 
                            The reason for this was that a signal duration of the approximate age of the universe (13.77 billion years) could 
                            accommodate only about 95 qubits. We propose a new scheme with the following properties: 1) a pair of oscillators 
                            or sinusioidal wave sources must be sufficient to emulate n superimposed states with the ability to be identifiably 
                            mixed or entangled, 2) the time required to perform a measurement of a state must not scale poorly with the
                            complexity of the state, 3) a fixed set of hardware components must be sufficient to emulate a system of a significant
                            number of qubits, and 4) at least as much must be knowable about an emulated quantum state as is expected to be 
                            measurable in a theoretical quantum computing system. We achieve a design whose time complexity scales favourably 
                            based on a new method of encoding quantum information into classical signals, but only anticipate the feasibility 
                            of encodings of up to 20 qubits with modern electrical hardware.

                            Three Quantum Programming Language Parser Implementations for the Web
                        </b>
                        <p>
                            IBM has developed a quantum assembly (QASM) language particular to gate model quantum computing since 2017 [CBSG17].
                            Version 3.0 which adds timing, pulse control, and gate modifiers is currently undergoing finalization in 2023 
                            [CJA+21]. In a similar vein, Pakin of Los Alamos National Laboratory published a quantum macro assembler (QMASM) 
                            for D-Wave quantum annealers in 2016 [Pak16]. This assembler specifically targets quantum annealers like D-Wave's. 
                            A comparable technology that targets continuous-variable (CV) quantum computing is the Blackbird language developed 
                            by Xanadu since 2018 [KIQ+19]. We implement parsers for each of these languages in TypeScript with a singular approach. 
                            In the cases of Blackbird and QMASM these are the first parser implementations that are web compatible and so bring these 
                            languages to a new audience and to new runtimes. This makes the parsing and execution of QMASM, QASM and Blackbird possible 
                            in web and mobile environments that don't have access to heavy compile toolchains, enabling adoption and scientific research.

                            Enabling the Verification and Formalization of Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing with OpenQASM 3.0 compatible QASM-TS 2.0
                        </b>
                        <p>
                            The unique features of the hybrid quantum-classical computing model implied by the specification of OpenQASM 3.0 
                            motivate new approaches to quantum program verification. We implement a typed QASM 3.0 parser in TypeScript to 
                            enable implementations of verification and validation software, compilers and more. We also propose that a formal 
                            treatment of OpenQASM 3.0's type system in type theory notation may further facilitate formal verification. We
                            highlight advancements in hybrid quantum-classical computing since the Quantum Hoare Logic to this end.
